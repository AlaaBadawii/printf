# Coding our own printf function in C programming
## 🛠️ Custom `_printf` Function in C

This project is a simplified reimplementation of the standard C library function `printf`.

It was built from scratch in C using low-level system calls and variadic functions. The goal was to better understand how formatted output works under the hood in C programming and to practice building functionality similar to the standard I/O library.

## 💡 Purpose

This project was part of a deeper dive into systems-level programming and working with variadic functions in C. It served as a valuable learning experience in:

- Writing custom output functions
- Handling format specifiers
- Using `stdarg.h` for variable arguments
- Working without relying on `stdio.h`
